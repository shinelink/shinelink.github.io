## Seasonal Flu

Seasonal influenza is a common respiratory tract infection caused by human seasonal influenza viruses. In Hong Kong, seasonal influenza  is usually more common in periods from January to March and from July to August.

Influenz A(H3N2) had the greatest impact, contributing around half of the excess respiratory mortality and respiratory
hospitalizations on average, with influenza B contributing the second largest average during the study period of
15.5 years from 1998 through 2013<a class="ptr">[1]</a>.

## History
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) started from 11 February 2003 when the World Health Organization first received reports from China on an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome occurred in Guangdong province, to 28 May 2004 when the Hong Kong government lowered the Alert Level of SARS response system <a class="ptr">[1]</a>.

## Data processing
Data can be obtained from <a href='https://www.fludb.org/brc/influenza_sequence_search_segment_display.spg?method=ShowCleanSearch&decorator=influenza'>Influenza Research Database (IRD)</a> in e.g. fasta format and use the Biopython package (<a href='http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html'>Tutorial</a>) to process the downloaded sequence data.  

I use the approach stated by Eric Ma who uses deep learning & genotype network-based system for predicting new influenza protein sequences.
