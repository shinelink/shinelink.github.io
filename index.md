## Seasonal Flu

Seasonal influenza is a common respiratory tract infection caused by human seasonal influenza viruses. In Hong Kong, seasonal influenza  is usually more common in periods from January to March and from July to August.

Influenz A(H3N2) had the greatest impact, contributing around half of the excess respiratory mortality and respiratory
hospitalizations on average, with influenza B contributing the second largest average during the study period of
15.5 years from 1998 through 2013<a class="ptr">[1]</a>.

## History
